# CU-campus-activities

Abstract

CU Campus Activities creates a platform that would be a more centralized hub for activities and events taking place on campus.
This project’s main goal is to create a platform that would be a more centralized hub for all activities and events taking place on campus. Because more individuals will have the ability to post an event, it will be much easier for events and activities to be known. The platform’s capability to share posts to Facebook as well as to your personal calendar ensures that events will be better distributed. The platform’s use of filtering allows users to choose their interests of activities they want to be notified for.

Problem 

Concord University lacks a central hub to host events for the fellow Mountain Lions. Finding current events can be tedious, often resulting in minimal event attendance. The main form of event advertisement is through Outlook, where the student body have their e-mails created through. This account, which should be used for academic success, becomes flooded with event spam.
Our software will reintroduce event advertising in a more flexible, accessible way. Students will be able to select their interests, R.S.V.P. for events, and have access to a live map showing where these events will be located.

Why use this software?

  ■ We aim to centralize events allowing administrators and organization presidents to post their events.

  ■ RSVP to ensure that your spot is secured.

  ■ Avoid excessive emails from the school.

  ■ Get the categories of events of your desire

  ■ By seeing an event posted in advance, students will be able to allot time within their schedule, ensuring they can attend their desired events.

  ■ Allow us to schedule accordingly

Future Plans

Future plans for the software would be to develop a mobile app. This app will have all the same things the current website does. It will allow you to select your interests, edit your interests and your profile, see when and where events you may like are taking place, and show you a calendar of your upcoming events. We would also like to work on making the student body and the faculty more aware that our software exists and push to make it a recommended piece of software by the university. Since our software will be so new we do envision a start-up period where maybe not everyone uses our software, but our future plans include getting our software to be used and recognized by the entire campus.
