# CU-campus-activities
CU Campus Activities creates a platform that would be a more centralized hub for activities and events taking place on campus.
This project’s main goal is to create a platform that would be a more centralized hub for all activities and events taking place on campus. Because more individuals will have the ability to post an event, it will be much easier for events and activities to be known. The platform’s capability to share posts to Facebook as well as to your personal calendar ensures that events will be better distributed. The platform’s use of filtering allows users to choose their interests of activities they want to be notified for.
